## Exercise - Failable Initializers

 Create a `Computer` struct with two properties, `ram` and `yearManufactured`, where both parameters are of type `Int`. Create a failable initializer that will only create an instance of `Computer` if `ram` is greater than 0, and if `yearManufactured` is greater than 1970, and less than 2020.

    var ram : Int
    var yearManufactured:Int

        //must have more then 0 ram
        if ram < 0 {
            
        }
        //vaid manfacturing date between 1970 and 2020

}

//:  Create two instances of `Computer?` using the failable initializer. One instance should use values that will have a value within the optional, and the other should result in `nil`. Use if-let syntax to unwrap each of the `Computer?` objects and print the `ram` and `yearManufactured` if the optional contains a value.
var computer1 : Computer? = Computer(ram: 16, year: 1970)
